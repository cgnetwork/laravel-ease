Laravel Ease comes pre-configured and ready to go out of the box. Customize the config file `ease.php` by publishing to your config directory.

## Directory Based Routing

Under the hood, dynamic routing is provided and powered by the Vite plugin - [Voie](https://github.com/brattonross/vite-plugin-voie)

For all the possible route combinations, see [Voie - File System Routing](https://github.com/brattonross/vite-plugin-voie#file-system-routing)
